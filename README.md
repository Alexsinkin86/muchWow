once upon a time there was small child named Bo

Bo's dad had a friend

This friend found a stray dog at a gas station

The friend called Bo's dad and asked if they wanted a gas station dog

Bo's dad said why not 

It was a weiner dog 

They named her Doodoo for reasons much to complicated for this readme

Bo had a problem, Doodoo was pregnant 

Bo had another problem, Doodoo had 7 puppies 

"What are we going to do with 7 puppies?" she asked
